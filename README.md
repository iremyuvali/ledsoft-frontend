internship project - ledsoft august 2022 

My project is about a shoe brand store website. I can explain this in two main parts:

The first part will be the index page that has a map and geolocation feature. We get userâ€™s location and show the prespecified store locations of the brand. Then, it is listed these brand websites. The user can reach the brand pages via link.

The second part is the brand page. This is an e-commerce page that includes home page, category detail page and product detail page. It's also added an about me page that has some information about me.
